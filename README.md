# QV21

This app load a CSV file and displays the records in a list.
Clicking on the list will open a new activity that allows you to edit those fields.
You can then save your edits by tapping the Save button, or return to the previous 
screen and leave the data untouched.

Got hung up on several issues:
  - Subclassed sample code kept private storage and did not subclass all methods that access data.
  - Samsung phones have special option to make USB available
  - Off-by one with UI elements
